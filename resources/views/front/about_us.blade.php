<!--						<p>Frank started his career with Philip McCormack Plant, holders of the main dealership for Moxy Dump trucks and Daewoo, where he worked as a field service engineer. From there Frank moved on to ASCON (BAM) where he specialised as the hydraulic and electrical fault-finding technician on the crane fleet. After two years with ASCON, Frank moved to McHale Plant Sales (a Komatsu dealership) to gain further experience within a main dealer environment. Not long after commencing his employment there, Frank was appointed as technical support engineer for the eastern and western regions. In 2003, Frank joined the family business, coming in as a partner to Fintan and Joan, his parents. Here, he gained first-hand experience in parts and sales within the industry.</p>-->
